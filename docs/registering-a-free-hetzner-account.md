# Registering a free Hetzner account

__Note:__  
If you want to use another provider for your server you can skip this step.

## Why Hetzner?

Hetzner is new to the cloud server market, but they offer cheap configurations that are more powerful than most of the competitive products. Our small server will be able to run multiple Node.js applications or start multiple process of the same application, as the smallest version already has 2 GB of memory.

## Sign up

Go to the [Hetzner Account Registration](https://accounts.hetzner.com/signUp?_locale=en) and create your free account.

You need to wait for an activation email and click on the link inside. It can also take some additional time until all features of the account are active, as the registrations have to be accepted by Hetzner.

If you can't create a project or server for longer, please contact the [support](https://www.hetzner.com/support-center?country=us).
