# What to get from this tutorial

This tutorial will guide you to setup a secure server to run multiple [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) applications with TLS encryption and a local [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) database. By using the [nginx](https://nginx.org/) webserver in front of Node.js we are able to run as many applications (with different domains) as we like.

Some parts of the tutorial, like setting up a local MongoDB server or Let's encrypt for TLS encryption can be skipped, if you don't need them.

We'll also learn how to setup Node.js applications as system services that restart themselves on a crash and that run automatically on boot.

Software that will be installed:

- Node.js
- MongoDB
- Nginx
- Let's Encrypt
