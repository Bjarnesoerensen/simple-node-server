# What to get from this tutorial

This tutorial will guide you to setup a secure server to run multiple [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) applications with TLS encryption and a local [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) database. By using the [nginx](https://nginx.org/) webserver in front of Node.js we are able to run as many applications with different domains as we like.

Some parts of the tutorial, like setting up a local MongoDB server or Let's encrypt for TLS encryption can be skipped, if you don't need them.

Software that will be installed:

- Node.js
- MongoDB
- Nginx
- Certbot
