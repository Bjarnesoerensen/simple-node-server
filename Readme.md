# Placeholders

Terminal commands and prepared files will have placeholders in them __that have to be replaced__ with values matching your setup. This could for example look like this:  
<pre>
ssh root@<b>{ip address}</b>
cd <b>{your application directory}</b>
</pre>

Your changed version should then look like this:  
<pre>
ssh root@192.168.100.50
cd /var/www/your-application/
</pre>

I suggest to create a text file where you store the details you use during this tutorial, so that you can copy &amp; paste them without always having to go back to your server management pages.

*new-server-config.txt*
```
Domain:
your-domain.com

Hostname:
node1.prod.your-domain.com

User:
peter

Password:
l0gM3!N?7&hc0m3L3tM3!nN0Wpl§$5%3

MongoDB User:
dbManager

MongoDB Password:
my53cur3L=g1nF/rd43m-nm0ng0DB
```

# Basic nano commands

We will use the [nano](https://www.nano-editor.org/) editor in this tutorial, but you're free to use any text editor you like in the terminal. If you're new to the console, here are some basic keyboard shortcuts you should know:

|[Ctrl] + [v]|Page down|Moves the cursor down one page.|
|[Ctrl] + [y]|Page up|Moves the cursor up one page.|
|[Ctrl] + [k]|Cut a row|Cut a row and add it to memory.|
|[Ctrl] + [u]|Paste memory|Pastes the memory you've cut before.|
|[Ctrl] + [w]|Search|Opens a box at the bottom to search for strings.|
|[Ctrl] + [o] => [y] => [Enter]|Save file|Saves the changes and leaves editor open.|
|[Ctrl] + [x] => [y] => [Enter]|Close editor and save|Closes the editor and saves changes.|
